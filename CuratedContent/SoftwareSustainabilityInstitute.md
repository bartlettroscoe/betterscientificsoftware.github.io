# Software Sustainability Institute

The mission of the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/) is to cultivate better, more sustainable, research software to enable world-class research (better software, better research). Software is fundamental to research: seven out of ten UK researchers report that their work would be impossible without it.
