 # Issue Tracking Software

Issue tracking software is used to make it easier for software developers to manage, record, track, resolve and be able to 
search on past issues, software bugs, or other problems. Issue Tracking software is especially useful in eliminating 
duplicate efforts. 
 
The Issue Tracking software that is used most frequently by software developers are listed but many other Issue Tracking Software
Tools are available such as for HELP desks and are more customer focused to deal with business practices and ITIL standards.

Software developers who collaborate and work in a community environment want simple but effective tools 
that are intuitive and easy to use. At the same time, they want the tool to be robust and have options that are straight forward 
to understand and are benefical to all the users of the tools. 

As a community, we are talking to scientific software developers to find out which tools they use that are the most effective for the 
way they work.  Some developers collaborate across the country and on different time zones and have to work rapidly to meet 
hard deadlines. 

## Examples of Issue Tracking Software
The following is a short list of Issue Tracking Software that is used or recommended by scientific
software developers in the High Performance Computing and Exascale Community.

There are many Issue Tracking Software systems that are used for a variety of purposes such as HELPDESKs and businesses 
who need ITIL standards.  This article will focus on Scientific Software Issue tracking tools for a community of people 
who collaborate across distances and disciplines (computer scientists, engineers, physicists, software developers, etc.) 

Issue tracking tools are chosen for a variety of reasons: 
1. Be accessible anywhere, from any system, i.e web based
2. Be available for both users to report bugs, track progress on requests
3. Allow developers to manage permissions for updating issues 
4. Provide email updates on status of issues
5. Allow priority setting on issues
6. Allow searching and sorting
7. Allow labeling issues with keyworks to facilitate searching
8. Allow establishing and tracking milestones needed for resolutions
9. Allow both users and developers the ability to add and update notes
10. Provide links from the issue tracker to the commits in the software that represent progress on the issue
11. Be intuitive to new and casual users, and retain features needed by experienced developers 
12. Have a help package and good documentation
13. Be affordable  (no hidden costs)
14. Provide many features and functions - (features not used can be transparent)
15. Provide history tracking, intuitive workflow, continuous integration, and real-time collaboration

modern web-based repository hosting systems, BitBucket, GitHub, and GitLab provide integrated issue tracking systems and support most,
if not all of the capabilities listed above.
