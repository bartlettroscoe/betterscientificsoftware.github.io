# Virtual Colaborative Whiteboarding on a Budget

### Introduction

Remote computational and computer software work is becoming more and more common where individuals work on a computer workstation from their homes or in some other remote location apart from other individuals that work on the same projects.
This trend was massively accelerated by the world-wide COVID-19 pandemic that caused dramatic changes in work environments in 2020.
In these remote-work situations, (arguably) remote video conferencing tools can provide almost the same level of communication and collaboration productivity as being collocated in the same office.
These tools allow technical people can talk (virtually) face-to-face, allow for remote computer screen sharing and even facilitate remote keyboard and mouse control to conduct pair programming and debugging sessions.
However, one luxury of collocated work that has proven difficult to duplicate over the years in a remote work situation is the shared whiteboard experience.

While it is often said a (static) picture is worth a thousand words, in many technical fields, there are cases where an interactive dynamic collaborative picture (i.e. a whiteboard) is worth many thousands of words.
The ability for two or more people to stand around a shared whiteboard (as depicted in Figure-???) to brainstorm a difficult problem or to convey a complex concept is an extremely effective communication vehicle in many technical areas.

### Criteria for a virtual whiteboard solution

While many different collaborative virtual whiteboard solutions are possible, for our purposes here, we seek a collaborative virtual whiteboard solution that has the following attributes/requirements:

* Provide for larger whiteboard area similar to the size of a whiteboard on the wall of an office wall.

* Support for Mac and PCs to view the whiteboard.

* Support for apps for iOS and Android for writing on the whiteboards with a digital pen.

* Allow using a drawing pen on the tablet and not have to use a mouse to draw on the computer.

* Not requiring specialized or expensive hardware not commonly owned.

* Support zooming in the tablet app to draw in finer detail on a section of the whiteboard.

* Move draw objects after they are drawn.  (A bonus over a physical whiteboard.)

* Be allowed for use by the institutions that employ the individuals.
