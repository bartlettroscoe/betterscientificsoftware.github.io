# Better Development

**Description:**  Aspects of scientific software development that should be systematically addressed in order to improve software productivity, quality, and sustainability.

**Overview:** Software development is a process of writing, maintaining, and extending source code to create software products. In a broad sense, software development includes all that is involved between the conception of the software through to the final manifestation of the software. 

**Topics:**

- **Documentation:**
Creating, maintaining, and hosting quality documentation (written text or illustration) about the use, operation, or design of software.

- **Revision Control:**
Approaches for managing changes to files (source code, documentation, data) as well as maintaining their history and attribution, especially across multiple contributors and branches of development (also known as version control).
