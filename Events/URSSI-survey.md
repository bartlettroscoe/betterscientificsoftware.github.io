The URSSI project seeks opinions from the US community about sustainable research software.

**Description:**  On behalf of the NSF-Funded [US Research Software Sustainability Institute (URSSI) conceptualization project](http://urssi.us), we are looking for your opinions about needs in the US research software community.
Please consider participating in [our brief 10 to 15 minute survey](https://nd.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8ik4azGuHmojKW9)
to provide input about how to increase the amount of sustainable research software that is available and how to increase
and improve the research that relies on that software.
We will use this information to plan a potential institute to carry out some of the activities in response to the needs.

Please feel free to share this survey with other research software developers and users.
