**This event has been cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.**

Abstract submissions are open for the 2020 Performance, Portability, and Productivity in HPC Forum, to be held April 7-9, in Kansas City, MO.  The deadline is January 24, 2020.

Authors are invited to submit novel research from all areas concerned with performance, portability and productivity. This forum is anticipated to attract a diverse and cross-disciplinary audience from laboratories, industries, and academic partners, bringing together: compiler, language and runtime experts; performance engineers; and domain scientists. Input from such a variety of experiences is critical to developing effective and productive solutions to performance portability, and tracking the highlights and lowlights of community experiences is key to identifying common themes and best practices.

### Topics of Interest Include:
- Extensions to standard languages, libraries and runtimes such as C/C++, Fortran, OpenMP, OpenACC, SYCL, OpenCL
- Algorithmic and application development techniques
- Software tools, libraries, domain specific languages and other abstractions
- Case studies, with both positive and negative experiences, documenting efforts to run across multiple diverse platforms using state-of-the-art tools and techniques
- Achieving performance portability for legacy codes
- Preparing applications for heterogeneous architecture
- Definitions of and metrics for measuring performance portability
- Experiences with burst buffers and other I/O approaches
- Productivity concerns related to the above topics

### Important Dates
- Submission Deadline: **January 24, 2020**
- Notifications: **February 7, 2020**
- Hotel room block closes: **March 16, 2020**
- Meeting: **April 7, April 8 and April 9 (1/2 day on the last day)**

### Submissions
The meeting organizers are seeking proposals for:
- Technical presentations (20 or 40 minutes)
- Breakout/Panel session topics (90 minutes)
- Posters
- And if you just want to be an active participant, you’re welcome to register

Please do not present any work under NDA (non-disclosure agreements) or classified information.

The work can be something you’ve already presented or published at a prior conference or workshop.

It can be a work in progress with preliminary results and observations, in fact this is highly encouraged as it will generate good discussion and feedback for your work.

Submissions are in the form of an abstract, 1 to 2 paragraphs. The submission form is limited to text only, i.e. no attachments, but feel free to include links to publications and/or illustrations that support your submission.
