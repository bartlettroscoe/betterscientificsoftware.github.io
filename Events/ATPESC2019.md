# Argonne Training Program on Extreme-Scale Computing (ATPESC 2019)

- Dates: March 4, 2019
- Location: Chicago area, Illinois, USA
- Event Website: https://extremecomputingtraining.anl.gov/

Doctoral students, postdocs, and computational scientists are encouraged to apply to this intensive two-week course.
Applications accepted through March 4, 2019.

**Description:** The Argonne Training Program on Extreme-Scale Computing (ATPESC) provides intensive, two weeks of training on the key skills, approaches, and tools to design, implement, and execute computational science and engineering applications on current high-end computing systems and the leadership-class computing systems of the future.

As a bridge to that future, this two-week program fills the gap that exists in the training computational scientists typically receive through formal education or other shorter courses. With around 65 participants accepted each year, admission to the ATPESC program is highly competitive. ATPESC is part of the Exascale Computing Project, a collaborative effort of the DOE Office of Science and the National Nuclear Security Administration.

The program will span two weeks, with lectures and hands-on laboratory sessions every day except Sunday. In addition to daily exercises, an exam will be given at the end of the program.

**Program Topics**

Renowned scientists, HPC experts, and leaders will serve as lecturers and will guide the hands-on laboratory sessions. The core curriculum will address:

* Computer architectures and their predicted evolution
* Programming methodologies effective across a variety of todayâ€™s supercomputers and that are expected to be applicable to exascale systems
* Approaches for performance portability among current and future architectures
* Numerical algorithms and mathematical software
* Performance measurement and debugging tools
* Data analysis, visualization, and methodologies and tools for Big Data applications
* Approaches to building community codes for HPC systems
